# OLAP Analysis Report

The data warehouse created for this task contains transaction data from the **UCI Online Retail** dataset, covering sales between **December 2010 and December 2011**. Using OLAP queries, we analyzed:

1. **Total sales by country**  
2. **Monthly sales trends for the United Kingdom**  
3. **Top 10 products by sales**

---

## Key Findings

- **Total Sales by Country**  
  The United Kingdom dominates overall revenue, far exceeding all other countries. This suggests the retailer’s core market is domestic, with international sales representing a smaller portion of total revenue.

- **Monthly Sales Trend – United Kingdom**  
  A clear seasonal pattern emerges, with sales volumes increasing significantly in **Q4 (October–December)**, likely due to holiday shopping. Smaller spikes in other months may correspond to seasonal promotions or events. This indicates the importance of intensified marketing and stock planning ahead of Q4.

- **Top 10 Products by Sales**  
  The highest-selling products are primarily gift and household items, such as decorative holders and seasonal goods. This highlights consistent customer interest in home décor and gifting products.

## Insights for Decision-Making

- Focus marketing campaigns and inventory stocking ahead of Q4 to capture seasonal demand.
- Maintain adequate stock levels for best-selling products year-round to sustain revenue.
- Explore growth opportunities in international markets where sales are currently low.

## Limitations

- The dataset is historical (2010–2011); trends may have shifted since then.
- Certain products or categories may no longer be relevant in today’s market.
- Integrating more recent data will improve the accuracy of strategic decisions.
